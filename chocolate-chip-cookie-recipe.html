                <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
                <p>Every kitchen needs a gold standard recipe for chocolate chip cookies. This one has earned its
                    stripes under fire, over many seasons, through countless licked spoons, spilled vanilla and extra
                    chips in the batter. Its quick baking time is the key to addictively chewy cookies that friends and
                    family won't be able to resist.</p>
                <p><b>By Chef Michael Smith</b></p>
                <p>YIELD: Makes about 18 cookies (depending on how much of the cookie dough you eat!)</p>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) softened butter</li>
                    <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon corn syrup</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Substitutions</h4>
                <p>For vegans like me, substitute the butter for sunflower oil, and a banana for the egg. Make sure the
                    chocolate chips are dark, and don't contain any milk or you might feel a bit sick.</p>

                <h3>Procedure</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 375 °F (190 °C).</li>
                    <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Using a stand mixer or a food processor, cream the butter and sugar together until smooth. If
                        you don't have a stand mixer, beat vigorously by hand in a large mixing bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add the corn syrup, egg and vanilla and continue beating until well combined. Scrape down the
                        bowl and gradually add the flour mixture, beating just until combined. Stir in the chocolate
                        chips.</li>
                    <li>Using a spoon, scoop out a ball of the dough, roll it for a moment in your hands and then drop
                        it onto a lightly greased cookie tray.</li>
                    <li>Slightly flatten the balls but leave lots of room in between to allow the cookies room to
                        expand.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Tips & Tricks</h4>
                <p>For a soft, chewy cookie, bake for exactly 12 minutes. For a cookie with a bit of crispy crunch, bake
                    for exactly 15 minutes.</p>
